# front-end

This is the space where we will develop our work for the user side of the Dokusho project.
Our goal is to make a pleasant, easy to navigate, simple to understand interface. Simplicity is the key.
When it comes to design, this page will be characterised by clear, clean-cut, unfussy lines. 
Choose natural colors that convey a sense of depth and a warm welcome, with simplicity and sophistication as the concepts to keep in mind. 
Don't forget the lighting.
