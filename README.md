# DokushoJo flashcard App
### Learn to Listen

Welcome to the DokushoJo app.
This is a zen design inspired flashcard applicaiton designed to help people who may be able to read or write but struggle with listening.
As of now we offer support for Japanese language learners only, but more features are always being added!

Just copy and paste what you want to study (or type it in yourself) and learn to listen in the most relaxing way possible.

This is the space where we will develop our work for the user side of the Dokusho project.
Our goal is to make a pleasant, easy to navigate, simple to understand interface. Simplicity is the key.
When it comes to design, this page will be characterized by clear, clean-cut, unfussy lines. 
Choose natural colors that convey a sense of depth and a warm welcome, with simplicity and sophistication as the concepts to keep in mind. 
Don't forget the lighting.
